## Synopsis

This project is a number guessing game.  The game was developed in order to practice Javascript and combine it with HTML and CSS.  DOM manipulation was also used to develop this project.  This project was developed for a class at the Turing School of Software and Design.

## Usage
One can either start guessing between 1 and 100 or set their own parameters and define the range.  If the player guesses too high then the game will tell them.  Similarly, if the player guesses too low then the game will also notify them.  Once the player guesses the right number, the range is increased an decreased by 10.  The user can continue to keep playing, and the range will expand every time they win.  If the player wants to restart the game from the beginning, they can press restart.  This sets the range back to 1 and 100.

## History

* Upon successful win, range is increased and decreased by 10
* Created a button to set new range
* Included inputs for minimum and maximum numbers
* Buttons do exactly what they are supposed to do
* Input field only accepts numbers within range
* Game displays results and feedback
* Added a function to create a random number
* Stylized all elements using CSS
* Created structure, inputs, and buttons with HTML
